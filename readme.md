# Sauerbraten Fork Data Files


This repository contains all data files for the [Sauerbraten Fork](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork) project.
It is intended as a minimal package (at a size of ~100MB ) covering only a few maps and core depencies.
A big problem is Sauerbraten is that not all content is entirely free, that is why we are having a strict [licensing guideline](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork/issues/14).
Currently the repository is straight work in progress.

## Goals

1. Create a cut down version of the sauerbraten core data files which do not conflict with the licensing
2. Provide a minimal package including some maps, models and textures for testing
3. Restructure the minimal package to fit [newpackaging](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork/tree/newpackaging)
4. Create a "backward-package" of popular Sauerbraten maps (additional) to make the game more familliar.
